-- Clue #1: We recently got word that someone fitting Carmen Sandiego's description has been traveling through Southern Europe. She's most likely traveling someplace where she won't be noticed, so 
-- find the least populated country in Southern Europe, and we'll start looking for her there.

-- find out what language is spoken in this country, so we can call in a translator to work with you.

She left us a note (below), and I'm sure she thinks she's very clever, but if we can crack it, we can finally put her where she belongs – behind bars.
--               Our playdate of late has been unusually fun –
--               As an agent, I'll say, you've been a joy to outrun.
--               And while the food here is great, and the people – so nice!
--               I need a little more sunshine with my slice of life.
--               So I'm off to add one to the population I find
--               In a city of ninety-one thousand and now, eighty five.
-- We're counting on you, gumshoe. Find out where she's headed, send us the info, and we'll be sure to meet her at the gates with bells on.
